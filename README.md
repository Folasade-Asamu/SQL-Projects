# SQL Project

## Covid19 Death Analysis
This project is to show the understanding and skills i have acquired in data extraction, cleaning with SQL and Excel and further visualization with PowerBI.

## Introduction
The world experienced a shift in 2020 as World Health Organisation declared a global pandemic in March 2020, caused by a Virus that originated from Wuhan, China.

This virus is called C0VID-19 and it caused global deaths. Therefore it is of utmost interest to know the spread and death caused by this virus and that is the focus of this project.

## Objective
This is to look into the confirmed cases, death of people globally and percentage of infected individuals monthly from March 2020 till April 2022. It is a personal project that aims at understanding the countries with the highest and lowest cases and deaths.

## Data Source
This data set was obtained from the "Our World In Data" where comfirmed death cases were recorded.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
Microsoft SQL and Excel 2016 was used to perform the data cleaning and transformation.

## Data Analysis

The data was extracted into Excel sheet, cleaned and then exported to SQL where exploration began and simple calculations were carried out.
Then I began to visualise.
For visualization, i copied the information i wanted to visualize into excel and loaded it in PowerBI.

## Data Visualization
The visualization on PowerBi can be viewed using this link https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ELeFz1y4kASrL6mf48p6FnkAla198Ide/edit#slide=id.p1

## Findings

- This analysis is focused on global impact of Covid19 from February 2020 to April 2021. 
- Out of 7.8bn people in the world during this period of time, 151m cases of Covid were recorded and 3m deaths occurred with a death percentage of 2%, which means there is a 2% chance that a person would die from the disease once infected.
- Europe had the highest number of deaths of 1.01m people. Africa had low death of 121k people and Oceania had just 1k total deaths.
- Among the total population in the selected counties, the US had the highest percentage of people that were infected with an average rate of 9.8% while Nigeria and China had the least percentage of 0.08% and 0.01% respectively.
- Also, the percentasge of people that got infected montly was higher in the US compared to Nigeria and China.
